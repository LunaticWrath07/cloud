# Flu Outbreak Monitoring Solution - Real-Time Data Processing with AWS

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time, event-driven solution using **Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Amazon QuickSight**. The focus is on creating a data processing and analytics pipeline that monitors flu outbreaks and hospital admissions in specific geographic areas.

The system enables real-time tracking of flu cases, hospital admissions, and outbreak hotspots, providing actionable insights through dynamic dashboards for public health management.

## Use Case: Flu Outbreak Monitoring

In today's interconnected world, the ability to monitor and respond to public health threats like flu outbreaks is essential for healthcare providers, government agencies, and communities. This solution leverages advanced data streaming and analytics capabilities to provide real-time insights into flu trends across specific geographic regions.

### Key Objectives:
- **Real-time data collection**: Flu outbreak data including patient demographics, symptoms, vaccination status, and hospital admissions.
- **Timely decision-making**: Providing healthcare professionals with the data they need to allocate resources and minimize virus spread.
- **Data-driven insights**: Helping public health departments and hospitals respond quickly to emerging flu hotspots.

## Solution Overview

The **Flu Outbreak Monitoring Solution** is built using a combination of AWS services that simulate real-world data generation, perform analytics, and visualize insights:

### 1. Data Collection with Amazon MSK:
- **Amazon MSK** is used to simulate streaming flu patient data across NY, NJ, and PA.
- The data includes patient age groups (10-90 years), symptoms, vaccination status, and hospital admission details.
- An **MSK Connector** simulates real-time data ingestion, providing a continuous stream of flu cases to the pipeline.

### 2. Data Streaming and Analytics with Amazon Redshift:
- **Amazon Redshift** ingests and stores the streaming data from MSK using its streaming ingestion capabilities.
- **Materialized views** in Redshift enable real-time analytics, such as identifying the top flu hotspots, tracking hospitalization rates, and analyzing flu severity across age groups.
- This solution supports **data-driven decision-making** by providing healthcare officials with up-to-date insights.

### 3. Visualization with Amazon QuickSight:
- **Amazon QuickSight** is used to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes flu outbreak data.
- The dashboard displays real-time trends, regional hotspots, and flu impacts across age groups and vaccination statuses.
- Stakeholders can quickly identify areas of concern and take proactive measures based on the latest data.
